# StarWars - Encounters
A web app created to make it easier to set up the initiative order of an encounter in the popular Fantasy Flight Game's Star War Role-playing game.

This is an alternative version to my EotE_Encounters project which was created to practice with .NET core MVC and Entity Framework Core. I created this version without a backend so it can be more easily deployed and used by others.
